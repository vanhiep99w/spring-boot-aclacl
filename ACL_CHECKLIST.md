- [x] Generic utility methods for permission management

## Validation Steps

### Manual Testing
```bash
# 1. Start application
mvn spring-boot:run

# 2. Check ACL status (should show entries)
curl -u admin:admin123 http://localhost:8080/api/acl/status

# 3. Test owner access (should succeed)
curl -u alice:password123 http://localhost:8080/api/documents/1

# 4. Test unauthorized access (should return 403)
curl -u dave:password123 http://localhost:8080/api/documents/1

# 5. Test public document (should succeed for all)
curl -u dave:password123 http://localhost:8080/api/documents/4

# 6. Test write permission (should succeed for owner)
curl -u alice:password123 -X PUT \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"Updated","content":"Test"}' \
  http://localhost:8080/api/documents/1

# 7. Test denied write (should return 403)
curl -u carol:password123 -X PUT \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"Hacked","content":"Bad"}' \
  http://localhost:8080/api/documents/1
```

### Database Verification
```sql
-- Check H2 console at http://localhost:8080/h2-console
-- JDBC URL: jdbc:h2:mem:acldb, User: sa, Password: (empty)

-- Expected: 5 users
SELECT * FROM acl_sid;

-- Expected: 2 classes (Project, Document)
SELECT * FROM acl_class;

-- Expected: 9 identities (4 projects + 5 documents)
SELECT * FROM acl_object_identity;

-- Expected: Multiple entries (owner + shared permissions)
SELECT * FROM acl_entry;

-- View permissions by object
SELECT 
    c.class,
    oi.object_id_identity,
    s.sid,
    e.mask,
    e.granting
FROM acl_entry e
JOIN acl_object_identity oi ON e.acl_object_identity = oi.id
JOIN acl_class c ON oi.object_id_class = c.id
JOIN acl_sid s ON e.sid = s.id
ORDER BY c.class, oi.object_id_identity, e.ace_order;
```

### Unit Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
mvn test

# Expected: All tests pass including:
# - AclDemoApplicationTests
# - AclInfrastructureTests
```

## Expected Results

### ACL Table Counts
- `acl_sid`: 5 entries (admin, alice, bob, carol, dave)
- `acl_class`: 2 entries (Project, Document)
- `acl_object_identity`: 9 entries (4 projects, 5 documents)
- `acl_entry`: 36+ entries (permissions)

### Permission Structure
Each owned object should have:
- Owner: ADMIN (16), READ (1), WRITE (2), DELETE (8)
- Shared users: READ (1), WRITE (2)
- Public objects: READ (1) for all users

### API Behavior
- Authenticated requests required for all `/api/**` endpoints
- ACL checks enforced on GET/PUT/DELETE operations
- 403 Forbidden returned when permission denied
- 401 Unauthorized returned when not authenticated

## Known Limitations

1. **H2-Specific**: Schema uses H2 syntax (@@IDENTITY)
2. **Basic Auth**: HTTP Basic is used (consider JWT for production)
3. **No ACL UI**: Permissions managed programmatically only
4. **No Inheritance**: Parent-child ACL relationships not implemented
5. **No Batch Checks**: Individual permission checks (may impact performance)

## Next Steps for Enhancement

1. Implement JWT authentication
2. Add REST API for ACL management
3. Implement ACL inheritance
4. Add batch permission checks for list operations
5. Create admin UI for permission management
6. Add comprehensive integration tests
7. Migrate to production database (PostgreSQL/MySQL)
8. Add audit logging for permission changes
9. Implement custom permissions beyond standard ones
10. Add group-based permission evaluation
